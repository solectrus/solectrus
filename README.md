## Live Demo

A live demo with realtime data is available at https://demo.solectrus.de

## Installation

For self-hosting SOLECTRUS, please look at https://github.com/solectrus/hosting

## Development

1. Clone the repo locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:solectrus/solectrus.git
cd solectrus
```

2. Install PostgreSQL, Redis, and puma-dev (if not already present). On a Mac with HomeBrew, run this to install from the `Brewfile`:

```bash
brew bundle
```

Ensure that PostgreSQL is running:

```bash
brew services start postgresql@16
```

3. Install and set up [puma-dev](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev) to use HTTPS for development. Do this on macOS:

```bash
sudo puma-dev -setup
puma-dev -install
puma-dev link

# Use Vite via puma-dev proxy
# Adopted from https://github.com/puma/puma-dev#webpack-dev-server
echo 3036 > ~/.puma-dev/vite.solectrus
```

4. Setup the application to install gems and NPM packages and create the database:

```bash
bin/setup
```

5. Start the application locally:

```bash
bin/dev
```

This starts the app and opens https://solectrus.test in your default browser (see `Procfile.dev`).

## Test

After preparing development environment (see above):

```bash
bin/influxdb-restart.sh
DISABLE_SPRING=1 bin/rspec
DISABLE_SPRING=1 RAILS_ENV=test bin/rake cypress:run
open coverage/index.html
```

RuboCop:

```
bin/rubocop
```

ESLint:

```
bin/yarn lint
```

TypeScript:

```
bin/yarn tsc
```

There is a shortcut to run **all** test and linting tools:

```bash
bin/test
```

## Performance monitoring

The [Live Demo](https://demo.solectrus.de) is hosted at Hetzner Cloud. For performance monitoring, it uses [RorVsWild](https://www.rorvswild.com), which is free for OpenSource projects. You can see internal metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage, as well as request times and errors here:
