      headline: SOLECTRUS needs sponsors!
      p1: SOLECTRUS is open source – that means freedom for you, but also hard work for the developer. If you want updates and new features to continue, this is only possible with your financial support.
      p2: By subscribing to a <strong>sponsorship plan</strong>, you not only ensure continued development but also gain access to <strong>exclusive features</strong> like the Power Splitter or Dark Mode. More sponsor-only features are in the pipeline.
      p3: Does that sound like a fair offer?
      more: Learn more about sponsoring
      continue: Continue
      skip: Maybe later
      p4: You can continue to use SOLECTRUS for free, but this notice will occasionally appear as a reminder of the sponsorship opportunity.
      login_required: To sponsor or see more options, please log in as an administrator.
