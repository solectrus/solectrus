      headline: SOLECTRUS needs sponsors!
      p1: SOLECTRUS is open source – which means freedom for you, but also a lot of hard work for the developer. If you want ongoing updates and new features, your financial support is essential.
      p2: By signing up for a sponsorship, you not only ensure continued development but also gain access to exclusive features, such as support for <strong>custom consumers</strong>, the <strong>power splitter</strong> to split consumption into PV and grid usage, and <strong>dark mode</strong>. Additional sponsor-only features are planned.
      p3: Does that sound like a fair offer?
      more: Learn more about sponsorship
      continue: Continue
      skip: Maybe later
      p4: You can use SOLECTRUS’s basic features for free, but this reminder about sponsorship will appear from time to time.
      login_required: To sponsor or see more options, please log in as an administrator.
